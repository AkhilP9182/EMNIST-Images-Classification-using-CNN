# EMNIST-Images-Classification-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network based classification model for classifying handwritten characters (digits and alphabets) trained using images from EMNIST dataset

The attached ipynb file (Akhil_EMNIST_CNN.ipynb) contains code blocks for:-
1. Loading data
2. Creating model
3. Training and Testing
4. Loss and Accuracy plots
5. Output v/s Ground truth Check

"training_logs.txt" contains the training logs for each iteration step within each epoch (lr = 0.005 and 0.0005 after 10 epochs, batch size=2048).</br>
"training_summary.txt" contains the summarized training loss values and accuracy after each epoch.

Below are the plots for the train/test loss values and accuracy v/s training epoch:
